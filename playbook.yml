    # Task 1: Install Python (if not already installed)

      # The `raw` module is used to execute commands directly on the target host.
      # This is necessary because Ansible requires Python to run its modules.
      # Once Python is installed, Ansible can use its regular modules for subsequent tasks.

    # Task 2: Update the yum package cache
    - name: Update yum cache
      yum:
        update_cache: yes
      # This ensures that the package list is up-to-date before installing any packages.

    # Task 3: Install required system packages for Docker

      # This adds the Docker repository to the system's package sources, allowing yum to install Docker.

    # Task 5: Install Docker Community Edition (CE)
    - name: Install Docker
      yum:
        name: docker-ce

      service:
        name: docker
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      # This ensures that the Docker service is running and will start automatically on system boot.

    # Task 7: Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub
    - name: Pull Docker image from Docker Hub
      docker_image:
        name: kryllion/weather-app:latest
